## Project Description

It's been a successful year as regional manager, but Oscar has already won a seat as state senator and is no longer on the financial team. Angela is on Dwight's case about keeping things on budget for a party he wants to plan for the Office, including inviting people like Kevin, Jim, Pam, etc. Dwight must carefully manage the expenses and transactions to ensure the party is a success without overspending.

Dwight has enlisted the help of Jim to handle the party planning, Kevin for catering, and Angela for decorations. As the head of the office, Dwight wants to make sure every transaction is tracked and categorized properly.
